            <p>As we near the end of the year, we enter into the time where people take stock of the year that has
                passed
                and
                begin to plan ways they can improve in the year to come. Most people make New Year’s resolutions, but
                these
                aspirations fizzle and fade anywhere between three weeks and three months. Well now you can do something
                different! Through these 10 practical tips, you can develop positive habits that will enable you to stay
                focused
                and persevere, allowing you to accomplish any goal you set.</p>
